     WELCOME TO THIS COOKING WEBSITE PROJECT
     ---------------------------------------
Generally this is not a solo project but a trio project.So a lot of features has been added into it...

Why Use this Repo ?


+ This Repo generally helps user understand the food culture of the india, italy and also introduces them to some cool desserts and inspires them to cook by themselves.

+ So Generally Cook by ourselves is our motto So we promote through this website.

+ And for some Students like us can inherit some code that is so useful.

What are all the features of these Website ?
Live Backgrounds for the Website pages.

Some Underline and boxing the Text Animations.

Introductions to pop-up Windows and pop-up Webpage.

Neon Text

Bugless flow of the webdocuments

Directing the webpage directly to gmail without copying the gmail id

Static Webpage so no copyrights exists (lol).

Important Note:


Since we know that github never allows to push the file more than 25mb into the git and as i have said i have used live backgrounds.
I done a lot of research and found out that for live backgrounds it is recommded to download the videos and implementing them instead
of using the iframe/embed tag to get from Youtube.

So i have compressed/reduced the quality of the videoes Used in the program so as to publish in this flatform...

But if do require this Project with high quality video :

Download the whole Files from : https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GPT-fzDrCg8FVcDCITTihOboaj-b-4el

Where u can find the whole files and enjoy...
Caution: the file is nearly 300mb.
